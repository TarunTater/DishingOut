The man was so sly, just keeping the gravy of the chicken and about 2 or three chicken pieces only. Being a reputed franchise if&nbsp;they do like this then, they should go&nbsp;learn to make rolls one get in Delhi and Noida with huge stuffing for the same price. And the bitter truth is that they taste better, is the same price, and is more filling. Also, they don't cheat like how they do in this place and do not serve burnt roti also.\", u'id': u'2450561', u'ratingColor': u'CB202D', u'reviewTimeFriendly': u'Aug 19, 2014', u'reviewTime': u'2014-08-19 19:44:59', u'thumb': u'https://c.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/204/dc504b3facef8dd60c0db7da1274f204_200_thumb.jpg'}\n"
